Data Description:
The file Bank.xls contains data on 5000 customers. The data include customer demographic information (age, income, etc.), 
the customer's relationship with the bank (mortgage, securities account, etc.), and the customer response 
to the last personal loan campaign (Personal Loan). Among these 5000 customers, only 480 (= 9.6%) accepted the 
personal loan that was offered to them in the earlier campaign.

Context:
This case is about a bank (Thera Bank) whose management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to 
personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability 
customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to 
devise campaigns with better target marketing to increase the success ratio with minimal budget.
